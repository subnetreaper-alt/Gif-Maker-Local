# Gif-Maker-Local
Local gif maker that allows you to use various effects on images turning them into gifs using your local machine to do the work credit to jnordberg https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js/blob/master/dist/gif.js is integrated to help the process the effects are anime sword slice, shatter explosion, glitch, and wave. Pixelate does not work it was a test. The overall goal was to achieve cool gif effects locally so as not to wait forever on a server run site.

Sidenote
for those who don't understand how to run
cmd from the folder click the path at the 
top ex:G:\anime_slice_gif_maker - test
after clicking it, it will highlight the path 
type CMD and it enter and it will open command
prompt from the specified path folder to ensure
it is attempting to load files from the correct
directory.

The Pixelate function was a test only and does not really do much and I was too lazy
to remove it lol but all other functions should would as intended.

All Gifs generated must be downloaded by right clicking on the generated gif 
and saving them to your desired location.

The maximum size it will output is 2000x2000 larger images will be scaled down 
to match this limit however smaller images do work better as it has trouble 
extending the gif to match larger images to a higher quality gif resulting in 
shorter animations. All gifs are generated locally using your hardware so if
it takes awhile please understand it is limited to the capabilities of your pc 
and be patient.
