### Sidenote

for those who don't understand how to run

cmd from the folder click the path at the 

top ex:G:\\anime\_slice\_gif\_maker - test

after clicking it, it will highlight the path 

type CMD and it enter and it will open command

prompt from the specified path folder to ensure

it is attempting to load files from the correct

###### The Pixelate function was a test only and does not really do much and I was too lazy

###### to remove it lol but all other functions should would as intended.

###### 

###### All Gifs generated must be downloaded by right clicking on the generated gif 

###### and saving them to your desired location.

###### 

###### The maximum size it will output is 2000x2000 larger images will be scaled down 

###### to match this limit however smaller images do work better as it has trouble 

###### extending the gif to match larger images to a higher quality gif resulting in 

###### shorter animations. All gifs are generated locally using your hardware so if

###### it takes awhile please understand it is limited to the capabilities of your pc 

###### and be patient.
